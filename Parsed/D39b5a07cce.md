Abstract
Background
In highly populated African urban areas where access to clean water is a challenge, water
source contamination is one of the most cited risk factors in a cholera epidemic. During


the rainy season, where there is either no sewage disposal or working sewer system, runoff
of rains follows the slopes and gets into the lower parts of towns where shallow wells
could easily become contaminated by excretes. In cholera endemic areas, spatial
information about topographical elevation could help to guide preventive interventions.
This study aims to analyze the association between topographic elevation and the
distribution of cholera cases in Harare during the cholera epidemic in 2008 and 2009.
Methods
We developed an ecological study using secondary data. First, we described attack rates
by suburb and then calculated rate ratios using whole Harare as reference. We illustrated
the average elevation and cholera cases by suburbs using geographical information.
Finally, we estimated a generalized linear mixed model (under the assumption of a
Poisson distribution) with an Empirical Bayesian approach to model the relation between
the risk of cholera and the elevation in meters in Harare. We used a random intercept to
allow for spatial correlation of neighboring suburbs.
Results
This study identiﬁes a spatial pattern of the distribution of cholera cases in the Harare
epidemic, characterized by a lower cholera risk in the highest elevation suburbs of Harare.
The generalized linear mixed model showed that for each 100 meters of increase in the
topographical elevation, the cholera risk was 30% lower with a rate ratio of 0.70 (95%
conﬁdence interval=0.66-0.76). Sensitivity analysis conﬁrmed the risk reduction with an
overall estimate of the rate ratio between 20% and 40%.
Conclusion
This study highlights the importance of considering topographical elevation as a
geographical and environmental risk factor in order to plan cholera preventive activities
linked with water and sanitation in endemic areas. Furthermore, elevation information,
among other risk factors, could help to spatially orientate cholera control interventions
during an epidemic.
Background
On the 20th of August 2008, an outbreak of 118 cases was declared at St. Mary’s and Zenenga
wards of Chitungwiza, a large urban centre on the outskirts of Harare [1,2]. Vibrio Cholerae
El Tor 01 was isolated from 18 (30%) of the 59 specimens submitted for examination, thus
supporting the clinical evidence for an outbreak [3].
Following this initial outbreak in Chitungwiza, a second wave of infections was reported a few
months later with numerous wards being affected and a rapid transmission of the infections to
the whole city of Harare. This is one of the largest and most extensive outbreaks of cholera yet
recorded in Zimbabwe affecting rural and urban areas [1–4].


In developing countries, cholera is closely related to poor environmental status and lack of
basic infrastructure. In this respect, high population densities and poor access to safe water
and proper sanitation, along with other environmental conditions, contribute to the spread of
cholera in Africa [5–7]. There have been several environmental risk factors described, related
to the origin of a cholera epidemic, such as sea surface temperature and more recently, air
temperature and rainfall [8–15]. In highly populated African urban areas where the access to
clean water is a challenge, water source contamination is one of the most cited risk factors in a
cholera epidemic. During the rainy season, where there is either no sewage disposal or
working sewer system, runoff of rains follows the slopes and gets into the lower parts of towns
where shallow wells could easily become contaminated by excretes. In cholera endemic areas,
spatial information about topographical elevation could help to guide preventive interventions.
In 1852, Farr hypothesized a causal relation between the cholera cases in the London
epidemic and the elevation, indicating that there was an underlying "natural law" correlating
infection with cholera inversely to elevation above high water. Farr stated that the elevation of
the soil in London had a more constant relation with mortality from cholera than any other
known element. In the same way, his contemporaneous colleague Snow, by mapping cholera
deaths by elevation, found a correlation between higher elevations and reduced risk for
cholera death [16,17].
Since 1852 there is some evidence about the association between cholera and elevation,
although there is no empirical data explaining this pattern [18–20]. Cholera appearance and
epidemic magnitude are related to the local environment [21]. New ﬁndings explaining
possible local ecological and environmental risk factors of cholera are of importance as they
could be used to prevent and plan future cholera epidemic responses in endemic areas.
Therefore, this study aims to analyze the association between topographic elevation and the
distribution of cholera cases, in Harare during the cholera epidemic in 2008 and 2009.
Methods
We developed an ecological study using secondary data.
Data were drawn from the registry of cholera treatment centers (CTCs) and oral rehydration
points (ORP) functioning during the cholera epidemic in Harare and Chitungwiza. Medecins
Sans Frontieres, in collaboration with the Department of City Health of the Ministry of Health
& Child Welfare, implemented and managed three CTCs, in the Budiriro Polyclinic, in the
Beatrice Road Infectious Diseases Hospital and in the city of Chitungwiza. Ten ORPs were
functioning in Harare city and one in Chitungwiza.
Data used in this study were the aggregated number of cholera cases by suburb of residence,
topographic average elevation of each suburb in meters, and the distance in meters from
suburbs’ geometric centre to Chitungwiza (the epicenter of the epidemic).
Population ﬁgures by suburb were calculated from the ofﬁcial census of Harare and
Chitungwiza, completed in 2002. To estimate the populations’ ﬁgures at the time of the
epidemic, we employed an average constant annual growth rate of 3%, as estimated by the
Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations
Secretariat [22].


During the epidemic, a cholera case was deﬁned as any patient presenting 3 or more liquid
stools and/or vomiting for the last 24 hours [23].
We described the elevation by suburbs and distance of each suburb to the epicenter
(Chitungwiza) in meters. Geographical information was integrated into the GIS database as
vector polygons. Using ArcGIS ‘zonal statistics’ module, we measured for each polygon
average ground elevation and the distance between each suburb centroid (geometric center of
the polygon) to Chitungwiza.
To describe the outbreak, we calculated attack rates for each suburb, including 95% exact
conﬁdence intervals (CIs). We assumed that the attack rates follow a Poisson
distribution [24,25]. We then estimated rate ratios and their respective 95%CIs, taking the
whole Harare rate as reference.
To describe the relation between the cholera cases and elevation, the Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcient (R) between the cholera rates and the mean elevation of each suburb was
calculated. Then, a scatter plot was built to show the relation between the observed rates and
the average elevation by suburb.
A generalized linear mixed model (under the assumption of a Poisson distribution) was used
to model the relation between the risk of cholera by suburb and the elevation in meters of
Harare: The model assumed a random intercept, with the number of cholera cases as the
dependent variable, the log of the population ﬁgures by suburb as the offset, and the suburb’s
average elevation as the independent variable [24,26].
We use prior knowledge about the dynamic and spread of the epidemic to allow for spatial
correlation between neighboring suburbs based on the distance in meters to the epicenter
(Chitungwiza) [12]. Therefore, the random intercept of the mixed model was used to account
for the dependency of neighboring suburbs, overdispersion and allowing for clustered
variance estimation [27]. In detail, we constructed a categorical cluster variable Q, based on
the quintiles (Q1 −Q5) of the distance of each suburb to Chitungwiza. Hence, our ﬁnal model
looks as follows:
ln(casesij)
=
ln(populationij) + β0 + β1 × (elevation in metersij)
+Qj(Random effect:(ﬁve clusters)
which corresponds to
ln(casesij) −ln(populationij)
=
ln
(
Cases
population
)
= β0 + β1 × elevation + Qj
The derived risk ratio of the model was interpreted as the cholera risk per 100 meters of
increase in the elevation, taking into account overdispersion and spatial correlation of the data.
Finally, the predicted rates of cholera by suburb were derived from the model using an
Empirical Bayesian estimation. This Empirical Bayesian approach consists of computing a
weighted average between the raw rate for each suburb and the regional average, with weights
proportional to the underlying population at risk [28]. Estimated rates were illustrated in a
ﬁgure in order to show the relation between the predicted rates and the elevation in meters.


Because of the random intercept, represented by the quintile variable (Q1 to Q5), predicted
rates by suburbs were clustered in groups following the speciﬁcation of the model.
A sensitivity analysis was developed to conﬁrm the consistency of our ﬁndings, consisting of
an iterative random selection of suburbs to build the cluster variable for the estimation of the
random effect. The aim of this process was to estimate the variability of the coefﬁcient of the
elevation, taking our ﬁrst estimation as reference and proving its consistency [29,30].
For the GIS component of the analysis (mean elevation and distance to the epicenter), a recent
(2008) high resolution satellite image of Harare was used. In order to assure a good
integration with ﬁeld surveys, the satellite image was geometrically corrected to ﬁt a set of
control points surveyed with a GPS. This image was used as a spatial reference for all GIS
analysis. Information from the Harare’s topographic map (Produced by the Surveyor General
of Zimbabwe), was digitized on top of the satellite image using Arcview software. The
elevation information was extracted from the SRTM database (a digital terrain model obtained
from the Space Shuttle mission). In this database, ground elevation is provided for each 90x90
meter cell of the model. The extent of each urban district was integrated to the GIS database
as vector polygons. Using ArcGIS ‘zonal statistics’ module, average ground elevation and the
distance between each suburb centroid (geometric center of the polygon) to Chitungwiza were
measured for each polygon.
The statistical software used for this study was Stata v.11.2 and the module ArcMAP of
ArcGIS (ESRI, v. 9.2) software for spatial and geographical representation.
Results
During this cholera outbreak, CTCs and ORPs in Harare and Chitungwiza registered and
cared for 19,422 persons who met the case deﬁnition. The epidemiological description of the
outbreak including the number of cases, attack rates and rate ratios by suburb is presented in
Table 1. Suburbs with highest attack rates were located on the south western area of Harare,
where overall, the average elevation is lower and the distance to the epicenter (Chitungwiza) is
smaller (Table 1, Figure 1: 1A and 1B ).

Figure 1 Distribution of cholera cases and average elevation by suburb in Harare, 2008-2009 (n=
19,422 cholera cases. (1a) Distribution of cholera cases by suburb (1b) Distribution of cholera
cases and average elevation by suburb)
This pattern of the spatial distribution of cholera cases correlates positively with the average
elevation of Harare suburbs. The computed Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient between the
cholera observed rates and the mean elevation by suburb shows a signiﬁcant negative
relationship, which means that at higher elevation, the number of cholera cases was lower
(R = −0.5; p-value < 0.001)
Figure 2 shows how the observed and predicted rates are related to the average elevation by
suburb in Harare. To make scales of Figures 2A and 2B comparable, we exclude from Figure
2A suburbs whose rates were more than two standard deviations away from the mean attack
rate (Hopley and Waterfalls). Lowess smoothing adjustment of the predicted rates (Figure 2B)
in relation to the average elevation by suburbs conﬁrms the pattern previously described in
Figure 1B. The risk of cholera decreases when the average elevation increases.
Figure 2 Observed rates and predicted cholera rates based on the generalized linear mixed model

rates (2b) Predicted cholera rates based on the generalized linear mixed model. Q1-Q5
represent the quintiles relating to the distance to Chitungwiza and the random intercept in the
model
Taking into account the overdispersion and the spatial correlation, the modeled relationship
between the risk of cholera and the average elevation shows the same pattern (lower elevation,
higher risk), with higher rate ratios for the suburbs that are located nearest to the cholera
epicenter (Chitungwiza, Figure 1B and Figure 2B). In Figure 2B, Q1-Q5 represent the
quintiles of the distance of each suburb to Chitungwiza; hence, Q1 refers to the cluster of
suburbs nearest to the epicenter, whereas Q5 refers to the cluster of suburbs which are most
far away from the epicenter. Speciﬁcally, this refers to the results of our generalized linear
mixed model which showed that an increase of 100 meters in elevation yields 30% lower
cholera risk, with a rate ratio of 0.70; (95%CI = 0.66-0.76). The sensitivity analysis conﬁrmed
the risk reduction with the increase of the elevation with an overall estimate between 20% and
40% (rate ratios between 0.6 and 0.8).
Discussion
This study shows a spatial pattern of the distribution of cholera cases during the epidemic in
Harare. This pattern is characterized by an increase of cholera risk for each 100 meters of
drop in elevation; lowest suburbs had the highest cholera risk.
During the cholera epidemic, Zimbabwe was in economic crisis: the health care systems had
become dysfunctional, water supplies were irregular and sanitation systems had collapsed.
The reason for this was a lack of maintenance of the system, with frequent power interruptions
affecting pumping stations [31–34]. On the 1st of December 2008, problems with the main


pumping station meant that, without prior warning, the water supply was shut off for Harare
city, leaving large populations without access to potable water. By 2008, Chitungwiza, a large
urban centre on the outskirts of Harare, had already been without an adequate water supply
water for more than 2 years. People had to revert to using unprotected shallow wells that were
at risk of contamination because of the dysfunctional sewer system [35]. Unprotected shallow
wells could support the pattern founded between cholera risk and elevation; hence, at lower
elevation, shallow wells could be contaminated easily by sewage disposal. During the rainy
season, in high populated urban areas, where there is either no sewage disposal or working
sewer system, runoff of rains follows the slopes and gets into the lower parts of towns [34].
A similar pattern could have happened in Haiti where the epicenter of the epidemic had been
located in the Artibonite area, which is a plain where rivers and surface water have high risk
of contamination compared with mountains, situation that reinforces the external validity of
our ﬁnding [36,37]. Water source contamination is one of the most cited risk factors in a
cholera epidemic in all the regions of Africa; therefore, lower elevation (like plains and
depressions) could facilitate contamination through surface water [38].
The diversity of regions affected by cholera epidemics during the last twenty years in Africa
and the multiplicity of risk factors need to be highlighted; however, lack of water and
sanitation facilities are the most common factors involved in the origin of an epidemic [38]. In
any case, topographical elevation in densely populated urban areas should be considered a risk
factor in endemic areas to plan cholera preventive activities linked with water and sanitation.
Furthermore, elevation information could help to spatially prioritize cholera control
interventions during an epidemic.
Our ﬁnding could be affected by the fact that data are based on estimated suburb population,
and we recognize that the estimates may not reﬂect the real ﬁgures during the epidemic.
However, we tried to take into account the natural average growth of the population to work
with most realistic population estimates possible. The internal validity could be affected for
data overdispersion and spatial correlation; however we used a mixed model with a random
intercept based on a neighborhood variable which is deﬁned via the distance to the epicenter.
In introducing a random intercept, suburbs within a cluster are allowed to be dependent.
Finally, to conﬁrm whether the choice of our neighborhood cluster for the mixed effect was
stable, a sensitivity analysis was developed ﬁtting the model with many other choices of
clusters specifying the dependency of suburbs (random choice, choice based on visual aspects
and also a second hierarchy). Even though this methodological approach is not the classic way
to account for spatial correlation, the standard errors of our estimations allow for suburbs
correlation within each of the ﬁve groups (spatial correlation), relaxing the usual requirement
that the observations are independent.
Our study focuses only on topographic elevation, but we have to highlight that there were
other historical, geographical, social, and environmental risk factors previously published, that
explained the spatial pattern of the Harare epidemic. Speciﬁcally, the fact that Tafara, a high
elevated suburb, had high cholera rates, could be explained by the dynamics of population
movement because there is a big concentration of bus stops and informal markets offering
service to the travelers moving to Mozambique. Bus stops and informal markets, residential
housing, water supplies and sewage disposal system were previously identiﬁed as risk factors
related with the cholera epidemic in Harare, 2008-2009 [12]. Finally, we need to highlight


that the risk of cholera by suburb cannot be attributed to one simple individual living in one
speciﬁc suburb due to the ecological fallacy.
Despite that fact, and to our knowledge, this study could be the ﬁrst attempt to model the
relationship between cholera risk and elevation. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis
developed reinforces the validity of our ﬁnal model conﬁrming the inverse relationship
between cholera risk and elevation.
Conclusion
In conclusion, it has been shown that the distribution of cholera cases by suburb in Harare
during the outbreak of 2008-2009 followed an identiﬁable spatial pattern characterized by a
lower cholera risk when the average elevation in meters by suburb increased by 100 meters.
During the rainy season, in high populated urban areas, where there is either no sewage
disposal or working sewer system, runoff of rains follows the slopes and gets into the lower
parts of towns. This study highlights the importance of considering topographical elevation as
a geographical and environmental risk factor in order to plan cholera preventive activities
linked with water and sanitation in endemic areas. Further studies are needed to explore the
link between elevation, water supplies and sewage disposal systems. The identiﬁcation of this
spatial pattern could guide public health action to orientate further preparedness interventions
in Harare, aiming to prevent a new cholera epidemic.
